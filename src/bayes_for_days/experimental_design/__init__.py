"""
Advanced Experimental Design module for Bayes For Days platform.

This module provides comprehensive experimental design capabilities for
real-world laboratory workflows with state-of-the-art methodologies:

- Variable definition and parameter specification systems
- Multiple design strategies (D-optimal, LHS, factorial, RSM, BAED)
- Laboratory-specific constraints and practical considerations
- Multi-unit support and concentration management
- Cost-aware and resource-optimized experimental design
- Multi-stage experimental design workflows

Components:
- variables: Variable definition and parameter specification
- design_strategies: D-optimal, LHS, factorial, RSM implementations
- laboratory: Laboratory-specific constraints and workflows
- adaptive: Bayesian Adaptive Experimental Design (BAED)
- optimization: Cost-aware and resource optimization
- workflows: Multi-stage experimental design management

Based on:
- Montgomery (2017) "Design and Analysis of Experiments"
- Atkinson et al. (2007) "Optimum Experimental Designs"
- Latest 2024-2025 research in model-based experimental design
