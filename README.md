```

### 2. Python API

```python
from bayes_for_days import BayesianOptimizer, Experiment
from bayes_for_days.core.types import *

# Define parameter space
parameters = [
    Parameter(name="temperature", type=ParameterType.CONTINUOUS, bounds=(20, 100)),
    Parameter(name="pressure", type=ParameterType.CONTINUOUS, bounds=(1, 10)),
    Parameter(name="catalyst", type=ParameterType.CATEGORICAL, categories=["A", "B", "C"])
]

# Define objectives
objectives = [
    Objective(name="yield", type=ObjectiveType.MAXIMIZE),
    Objective(name="cost", type=ObjectiveType.MINIMIZE)
]

# Create experiment configuration
config = ExperimentConfig(
    name="Chemical Process Optimization",
    parameter_space=ParameterSpace(parameters=parameters),
    objectives=objectives,
    acquisition_function=AcquisitionFunction.EXPECTED_PARETO_IMPROVEMENT,
    model_type=ModelType.ENSEMBLE,
    max_iterations=100
)

# Define objective function
def evaluate_process(params):
    # Your experimental evaluation code here
    temperature = params["temperature"]
    pressure = params["pressure"]
    catalyst = params["catalyst"]

    # Simulate or run actual experiment
    yield_value = simulate_yield(temperature, pressure, catalyst)
    cost_value = calculate_cost(temperature, pressure, catalyst)

    return {"yield": yield_value, "cost": cost_value}

# Run optimization
experiment = Experiment(config)
result = experiment.run(evaluate_process)

print(f"Best point: {result.optimization_result.best_point}")
print(f"Pareto front size: {len(result.optimization_result.pareto_front)}")
```
